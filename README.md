# React-Native
Create React Native App is the easiest way to start building a new React Native application. It allows you to start a project without installing or configuring any tools to build native code - no Xcode or Android Studio installation required.

Assuming that you have Node installed, you can use npm to install the create-react-native-app command line utility:

npm install -g create-react-native-app

Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

create-react-native-app AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start

This will start a development server for you.

Running your React Native application

Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.


Modifying your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it. Open App.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines. The application should reload automatically once you save your changes.
That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.
